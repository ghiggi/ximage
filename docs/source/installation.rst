Installation
=========================


We define here two types of installation:

- `Installation for standard users`_: for users who want to process data.

- `Installation for contributors`_: for contributors who want to enrich the project (eg. add a new reader).

We recommend users and contributors first set up a virtual environment to install ximage.


.. _virtual_environment:

Virtual environment creation
===============================

While not mandatory, utilizing a virtual environment when installing ximage is recommended.

Using a virtual environment for installing packages provides isolation of dependencies,
easier package management, easier maintenance, improved security, and improved development workflow.

Below we provide two options to set up a virtual environment,
using `venv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__
or `conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__ (recommended).

**With conda:**

* Install `miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__
  or `anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`__
  if you don't have it already installed.

* Create the *ximage-py311* (or any other custom name) conda environment:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda create --name ximage-py311 python=3.11 --no-default-packages

* Activate the *ximage-py311* conda environment:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda activate ximage-py311


**With venv:**

* Windows: Create a virtual environment with venv:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m venv ximage-pyXXX
   cd ximage-pyXXX/Scripts
   activate


* Mac/Linux: Create a virtual environment with venv:

.. code-block:: bash

   virtualenv -p python3 ximage-pyXXX
   source ximage-pyXXX/bin/activate

.. _installation_standard:

Installation for standard users
==================================

The latest ximage stable version is available
on the `Python Packaging Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/ximage/>`__
and on the `conda-forge channel <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ximage>`__.

Therefore you can either install the package with pip or conda (recommended).
Please install the package in the virtual environment you created before!

**With conda:**

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge ximage


.. note::
   In an alternative to conda, if you are looking for a lightweight package manager you could use `micromamba <https://micromamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

**With pip:**

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install ximage


.. _installation_contributor:

Installation for contributors
================================

The latest ximage version is available on the GitHub repository `ximage <https://github.com/ghiggi/ximage>`_.
You can install the package in editable mode, so that you can modify the code and see the changes immediately.
Below we provide the steps to install the package in editable mode.

Clone the repository from GitHub
......................................

According to the :ref:`contributors guidelines <contributor_guidelines>`,
you should first
`create a fork into your personal GitHub account <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo>`__.

Then create a local copy of the repository you forked with:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/<your-account>/ximage.git
   cd ximage

Create the development environment
......................................

We recommend creating a dedicated conda environment for development purposes.
You can create a conda environment (i.e. with python 3.11) with:

.. code-block:: bash

	conda create --name ximage-dev-py311 python=3.11 --no-default-packages
	conda activate ximage-dev-py311

Install the package dependencies
............................................

.. code-block:: bash

	conda install --only-deps ximage


Install the package in editable mode
................................................

Install the ximage package in editable mode by executing the following command in the ximage repository's root:

.. code-block:: bash

	pip install -e ".[dev]"


Install code quality checks
..............................................

Install the pre-commit hook by executing the following command in the ximage repository's root:

.. code-block:: bash

   pre-commit install


Pre-commit hooks are automated scripts that run during each commit to detect basic code quality issues.
If a hook identifies an issue (signified by the pre-commit script exiting with a non-zero status), it halts the commit process and displays the error messages.

.. note::
	The versions of the software used in the pre-commit hooks are specified in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml <https://github.com/ghiggi/ximage/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml>`__ file. This file serves as a configuration guide, ensuring that the hooks are executed with the correct versions of each tool, thereby maintaining consistency and reliability in the code quality checks.

Further details about pre-commit hooks can be found in the Contributors Guidelines, specifically in the provided in the :ref:`Code quality control <code_quality_control>` section.


Run ximage on Jupyter Notebooks
=====================================

If you want to run ximage on a `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`__,
you have to take care to set up the IPython kernel environment where ximage is installed.

For example, if your conda/virtual environment is named ``ximage-dev``, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=ximage-dev

When you will use the Jupyter Notebook, by clicking on ``Kernel`` and then ``Change Kernel``, you will be able to select the ``ximage-dev`` kernel.
