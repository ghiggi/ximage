Welcome to ximage documentation !
==================================


In data analysis and working with image, video or climate simulations, handling large, complex
datasets can be challenging.
Moreover, when dealing with multidimensional data, using index-based dimensions can lead to mistakes.

Xarray provides a handy way to manipulate multidimensional arrays with labeled dimensions,
but lack of tools to perform classical image/video processing manipulations.

Ximage fill these gaps by providing utilities to:
- label multidimensional arrays
- extract multidimensional patches around labels
